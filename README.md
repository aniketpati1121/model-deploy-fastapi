🚀 End-to-End Machine Learning Model Deployment using FastAPI

This repository demonstrates the complete workflow of deploying a machine learning model using FastAPI — from training the model to building an interactive API that serves predictions.

✅ Key Features
📦 Model Training: Train a sample ML model using scikit-learn (e.g., classification/regression).

🧠 Model Serialization: Save and load models using joblib or pickle.

⚡ FastAPI Backend: Serve the model using FastAPI for blazing-fast performance.

📨 POST/GET Endpoints: Simple endpoints to test predictions with JSON payloads.

📄 Swagger UI & ReDoc: Auto-generated documentation at /docs and /redoc.

🧪 Testing: Includes sample test inputs to validate your API.

🔧 Docker Support: Containerized with Docker for easy deployment anywhere.

🌐 CORS & Middleware: Setup for secure cross-origin requests.
